## Addon installation

Download a release from [Releases](https://github.com/gogobd/alphamesh-addon/releases), then open it with Blender in Preferences, Install Addon...


## Usage:

You'll find a section called "AlphaMesh addon" in Object Properties. This will be active when you select an AlphaMesh object (you find them in Add->Mesh->AlphaMesh). Just select an object and then its particle system. The Alpha value defines how concave the mesh will be.
